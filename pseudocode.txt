Simon Game Pseudo-code

1) Define required constants
- sequence length to win - 8
- timeout value for players turn (multiple of current sequence length?)
- duration of each sequence element (light and sound)
- duration of pause between sequence elements

2) Define required variables used to track the state of the game
- current sequence, an array
- current element, array index
- turn (computer or player)

3) Store elements on the page that will be accessed in code more than once in variables to make code more concise, readable and performant.
- DOM elements for each color space on the game board
- DOM element for "Game Over" message;
- DOM elements for sequence length and sequence remaining counters

4) Upon loading the app should:
- initialize the state variables
- render those values to the page
- start the game sequence with one random element
- play the sequence
- wait for the user to click a square

5) Handle a player clicking a square
- check that the space clicked is the next one in the sequence
- if it is then set the current sequence element to the next one
- otherwise display "Game Over" message

6) Handle timeout of turn
- display "Game Over" message

7) Handle a player clicking the replay button
- re-initialize
